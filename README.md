This is buy-me-a-coffee dapp, where you can donate ETH to the desired team or company and support them in a coffee manner!

In order to test it, go through these steps on your own code editor:

1- First you should go through the desired folder you want the project to be deployed using "ls" for listing the folders and "cd" for opening it (or you can right click on the folder if you have git installed, and open git bash there and there use "code ." command and hit enter. 
2- While in the right directory, use this command in the terminal: "git init"
3- Then this: "git clone https://github.com/Parsa-03/buy-me-a-coffee-dapp.git"
4- Finally, you can use "cd BuyMeACoffee-Solidity-DeFi-Tipping-app" to go to it's directory, and use "npm run dev" command to compile the front and interact with it in your browser (would be viewable at usually http://localhost:3000)
