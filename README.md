# Buy Me A Coffee Project

This is buy-me-a-coffee DApp, where you can donate ETH to the desired team or company and support them in a coffee manner!

*2024 Update: This project is now up and running at `https://buy-me-a-coffee.xyz/`; go on and test it! Please give me any constructive feedback as I would be happy to hear them! 

In order to test it on your system, go through these steps on your own code editor:

1- First you should go through the desired folder you want the project to be deployed using "ls" for listing the folders and "cd" for opening it (or you can right-click on the folder if you have git installed, and open git bash there and there use "code ." command and hit enter.

2- While in the right directory, use this command in the terminal: "git init"

3- Then this: "git clone https://github.com/Parsa-03/buy-me-a-coffee-dapp.git"

4- After cloning the repository successfully, you can use "cd buy-me-a-coffee-dapp\BuyMeACoffee-Solidity-DeFi-Tipping-app" to go to its directory and in the terminal, use "npm install" or "yarn install" to install all required dependencies.

5- Finally, use "npm run dev" or "yarn run dev" command to compile the front and interact with it in your browser (would be viewable at usually http://localhost:3000)
